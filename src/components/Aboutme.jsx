        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! my name is Tracy. I am passionate about Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Data Science, and I have strong domain knowledge in trading, finance, and banking. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Analytics at the University of Niagara Falls, Canada. I am seeking a co-op opportunity for Fall 2025, after which I will return to school to complete my studies. I expect to graduate in March 2026 and will be looking for full-time opportunities in Canada thereafter. I am eligible to work in Canada and do not require sponsorship.</p>

        <p>With over 8 years of experience in full-stack development and technical leadership in Singapore, I have designed and delivered enterprise solutions for organizations like the Philippine Dealing System (PDS Group), Eastspring Investments, and CSOP Asset Management. As Technical Lead at ESGpedia, I led the architecture and development of the ESGpedia and Vetta Smart Contract platforms.</p>

        <p>I’ve also mentored talent through SGInnovate’s PowerX program and contributed to projects including e-signature platforms for GIC, trade finance solutions for CCRManager, and SGX stock market integration for StarHub IPTV.</p>

        <p>I hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Systems Analysis from National University of Singapore (NUS) and a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics from Mandalay Technological University (MTU).</p>
